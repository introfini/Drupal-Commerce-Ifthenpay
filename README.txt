This module provides a Drupal Commerce payment method for the Portuguese payment gateway Ifthenpay.

Ifthenpay gateway allows customers to generate their own Multibanco References for each Commerce order. Clients can then pay by debit card, via the ATM network – Multibanco.

Multibanco is an interbank network in Portugal owned and operated by Sociedade Interbancaria de Serviços S.A. (SIBS), that links the ATMs of all the banks in Portugal. The bank members of Multibanco control the SIBS. Multibanco is a fully-integrated interbank network and offers more services than the usually found in other countries, making that one of its most known characteristics. Multibanco in itself does not only encompass ATMs. It has a full-fledged EFTPOS network called Multibanco Automatic Payment, and is also a provider of mobile phone and Internet banking services through the TeleMultibanco, MBNet and most recently MBWay services.

The integration with the MBWay payment method is currently under development.
